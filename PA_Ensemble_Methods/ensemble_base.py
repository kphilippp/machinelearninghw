def id3(x, y, attribute_value_pairs=None, depth=0, max_depth=5, weights=None):
    """
    Implements the classical ID3 algorithm given training data (x), training labels (y) and an array of
    attribute-value pairs to consider. This is a recursive algorithm that depends on three termination conditions
        1. If the entire set of labels (y) is pure (all y = only 0 or only 1), then return that label
        2. If the set of attribute-value pairs is empty (there is nothing to split on), then return the most common
           value of y (majority label)
        3. If the max_depth is reached (pre-pruning bias), then return the most common value of y (majority label)
    Otherwise the algorithm selects the next best attribute-value pair using INFORMATION GAIN as the splitting criterion
    and partitions the data set based on the values of that attribute before the next recursive call to ID3.

    The tree we learn is a BINARY tree, which means that every node has only two branches. The splitting criterion has
    to be chosen from among all possible attribute-value pairs. That is, for a problem with two features/attributes x1
    (taking values a, b, c) and x2 (taking values d, e), the initial attribute value pair list is a list of all pairs of
    attributes with their corresponding values:
    [(x1, a),
     (x1, b),
     (x1, c),
     (x2, d),
     (x2, e)]
     If we select (x2, d) as the best attribute-value pair, then the new decision node becomes: [ (x2 == d)? ] and
     the attribute-value pair (x2, d) is removed from the list of attribute_value_pairs.

    The tree is stored as a nested dictionary, where each entry is of the form
                    (attribute_index, attribute_value, True/False): subtree
    * The (attribute_index, attribute_value) determines the splitting criterion of the current node. For example, (4, 2)
    indicates that we test if (x4 == 2) at the current node.
    * The subtree itself can be nested dictionary, or a single label (leaf node).
    * Leaf nodes are (majority) class labels

    Returns a decision tree represented as a nested dictionary, for example
    {(4, 1, False):
        {(0, 1, False):
            {(1, 1, False): 1,
             (1, 1, True): 0},
         (0, 1, True):
            {(1, 1, False): 0,
             (1, 1, True): 1}},
     (4, 1, True): 1}
